            <p>Starting university was a nerve racking experience in and of itself. Throughout all high school I had suffered from chronic major <b>depression</b> and anxiety. I had already attempted suicide twice and while entering my first year of university there was an air of uncertainty. 

After entering my first year, the atmosphere was welcoming to say the least. There was ample amounts of opportunity to get involved however, as an introverted shy kid I backed away. I saw the opportunities to get involved fade away. While I tried my best to keep up and go to classes I found that I had no real motivation to attend the classes. That in return created more stress and anxiety that just fed into my <b>depression</b>. Midterms were a struggle but I pulled through, anxiously waiting to marks and calculating what I needed afterwards to pass the course. I thought I was way over my head, and maybe at the time I was right. Finals came around and I slipped into the same habits of midterms, procrastination then stressing and anxiety. In the end hoping I passed first year.

Second year wasn’t any better. Again, there were opportunities to be involved at the beginning of first semester, and I didn’t take advantage. I had decided to move out of residence and talked with the landlord who said they would have other students live in the building as well. Circumstances changed and they rented out to individuals who were not students and kept to themselves. I had ended up in a terrible living situation which resulted in myself feeling isolated and <b>depressed</b>. I had discussed with my parents about dropping out and not wanting to continue school. However, things started to change when I met some individuals who were kind enough to let me in their circle. I began to socialize with them more and more during class and after class. I had established a social group, and my attitude of dropping out slowly changed.

Although my <b>depression</b> would not dissipate right away, I felt a sense of relief that I had individuals to socialize and connect with. They encouraged me to be more engaged and attend different events such as Guelph’s netiquette put on by the CBESA. I was extremely nervous and stressed out about the netiquette dinner but things went well and everyone was welcoming. I began to attend classes more often that my new friends were in, and enjoyed going.

 Third year was better, and I had made a plan during the summer to implement to help manage my <b>depression</b> and anxiety more. I would take a proactive approach to my mental health by being active every day regardless of the circumstances, eating healthy meals, and getting a proper amount of sleep. 

The results spoke for themselves. My average had increased and I was also able to manage my time more efficiently because everything else was being scheduled and managed. I was no longer at the mercy of my mental health, but taking control of it and accepting it as a part of who I was. I was an individual with chronic major <b>depression</b> or persistent <b>depressive</b> disorder.

I’m now in fourth year, completing my last semester and I keep up with the same routine I had created in third year. I have grown my social network and enjoy going and participating in class. Slowly changing but always moving forward.
